# Google Maps API Demo

## [Live Demo](https://michaelmcmullin.github.io/Google-Maps-API-Demo/)

This page began by following along with Udacity's [Google Maps APIs course](https://www.udacity.com/course/google-maps-apis--ud864).
Most of the starter code came from there originally (check out their [repo here](https://github.com/udacity/ud864)).

This version has a few changes. It uses jQuery, TypeScript and Grunt to clean up the scripts
a little. It also works through some of the exercises not covered by the instructors, such as:

* Adding a toggleable traffic layer
* Toggleable styled maptype option
* Nice little directions panel when you click 'Show Route' (Use the 'Search for listings within'
section and click on any listings that show up to see this function in action)
* Prev/Next links to scroll through photos in place search

Enjoy!

## NOTE
This version uses my own Google API Key, which is generally restricted. Please obtain and use your
own API key if you decide to make use of this code.
